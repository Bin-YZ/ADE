ADE_DG
======

**ADE_DG** is a Python tool using FEniCSx for numerical simulations of diffusive transport in diffusion cells.

Jupyter notebooks are used to set up diffusion calculations with ADE_DG, that can be used for fitting data from (Lab-) diffusion experiments either manually or with help of LMFIT (https://lmfit.github.io/).

The documentation is made with help of sphinx.
